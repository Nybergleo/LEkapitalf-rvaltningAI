\section*{A. Common Themes Across Reports}
\subsection*{Operational trends}
\subsubsection*{Service and aftermarket resilience}
Description: Multiple reports describe service, aftermarket or rental as a stable or growing revenue stream that partially offsets weakness in new equipment sales.

Companies: Atlas Copco; Sandvik; SKF; Trelleborg; Volvo; Alleima

Tone: positive

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Atlas Copco: "The overall demand for service, including the specialty rental business, continued to develop favourably"

  \item Evidence: SKF: "service sales growing by 4\% adjusted for currency"
  \item Evidence: Trelleborg: "Service sales increased by 6\% adjusted for currency"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: "service sales increasing by 4\%"
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "Free operating cash flow... impacted by lower operating profit and increased investments" (service cited elsewhere as resilience)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Capacity, production and maintenance impacts}
Description: Several companies report production disruptions, maintenance stoppages or targeted capacity adjustments that affected near-term output and earnings.

Companies: Alleima; Volvo; Sandvik; SKF

Tone: mixed

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "impacted by the extended maintenance stoppage over the summer at one of the largest production units in Sandviken"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: "operating cash flow was negatively impacted by the normal seasonality with lower production in Q3"
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "inventory management had a positive effect" (operational focus)
  \item Evidence: SKF: "The announced rightsizing initiatives continues at high pace" (capacity/cost adjustments)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{M\&A, bolt-on acquisitions and divestments}
Description: Several groups executed bolt-on acquisitions and some completed divestments; companies frame this as strategic to focus portfolios or expand capabilities.

Companies: Atlas Copco; Sandvik; Trelleborg; Volvo; Alleima

Tone: neutral

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Atlas Copco: "The following acquisitions were closed in the quarter" (list of acquisitions)
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: multiple acquisitions in 2025 listed and acquisitions impact margins initially
  \item Evidence: Trelleborg: "completed the acquisition of Masterseals"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: completed acquisition of Truck Centre Western Australia and divestment of SDLG
  \item Evidence: Alleima: acquisition of Endox announced and impact noted
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{External factors}
\subsubsection*{Trade policy, tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty}
Description: Several reports cite trade policy turbulence or tariffs as a material influence on customer behaviour, pricing and costs; many discuss mitigation measures.

Companies: Alleima; Atlas Copco; Sandvik; SKF; Volvo

Tone: mixed

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "trade policy turbulence" and "cautious attitude among customers, especially in Europe"
  \item Evidence: Atlas Copco: "changes in trade agreements, trade sanctions, tariffs" and "increased costs related to trade tariffs"
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "Tariff surcharges were implemented" and "Tariffs were fully off-set by surcharges"
  \item Evidence: SKF: "given the geopolitical sentiment... We expect... to largely compensate for increased tariff costs"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: "tariff costs ... net tariff impact is negative" and "uncertain regarding EPA 2027 emissions standards and the impact of tariffs"
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Currency headwinds and translation effects}
Description: Strong recurring mention of negative currency impacts on earnings and margins; many quantify the effect and call it a headwind.

Companies: Alleima; Atlas Copco; Sandvik; SKF; Trelleborg; Volvo

Tone: negative

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "currency effects of SEK -41 million... currency headwind is expected"
  \item Evidence: Atlas Copco: "exchange rates had a negative effect of MSEK 1 695"
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "currency headwinds impacted the margin by 130 basis points"
  \item Evidence: SKF: "currency effects impacted net sales negatively by -6.9\%"
  \item Evidence: Trelleborg: "currency effects had a negative impact of SEK 90 m on EBITA"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: "currency movements had a negative impact of SEK 1,626 M"
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Sustainability and decarbonization targets}
Description: Multiple companies highlight sustainability commitments, CO2 targets, or recognition (SBTi, EcoVadis) and progress on emissions.

Companies: Alleima; Sandvik; SKF; Trelleborg; Volvo

Tone: positive

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "climate targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)"
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "progress in the Circularity program" and "Net zero KPI reporting"
  \item Evidence: SKF: "CO2e emissions for the quarter declined 43 percent" and SBTi targets described
  \item Evidence: Trelleborg: "Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide emissions for the quarter declined 43 percent"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: references to zero-emission initiatives and Coretura joint venture
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Demand and order-related commentary}
\subsubsection*{Mixed demand by geography and segment}
Description: Reports repeatedly describe geographic variability (Europe, North America, Asia) and segment winners/laggards (e.g., Mining, Medical, Automotive).

Companies: Alleima; Atlas Copco; Sandvik; SKF; Trelleborg; Volvo

Tone: mixed

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "mixed market conditions... customers in Europe are holding off"; Nuclear and Medical segments strong
  \item Evidence: Atlas Copco: "demand was mixed... increased in the Americas and Europe, unchanged in Asia"
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "Mining remained very strong... infrastructure market remained subdued"
  \item Evidence: SKF: "Automotive business declined -2\%... Industrial grew 4\%"
  \item Evidence: Trelleborg: "Mining strong; project oil \& gas down; Automotive mixed"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: "Europe stable/replacement-driven; North America weak freight market"
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Order intake/backlog and book-to-bill variability}
Description: Companies reference order intake changes, rolling 12-month book-to-bill, and backlog impacts on near-term visibility.

Companies: Alleima; Atlas Copco; Sandvik; Volvo; Trelleborg

Tone: mixed

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "Order intake for the rolling 12-month period decreased by 5\%... Book-to-bill was 97\%"
  \item Evidence: Atlas Copco: "Orders received 40,517 (42,080), organically unchanged"
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "Total order intake increased by 7\%... Organic order intake growth of 16\%"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: "Net order intake decreased by 14\%... deliveries decreased by 4\%"
  \item Evidence: Trelleborg: "Total order intake increased by 7\%... organic 16\%"
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Cost or margin-related commentary}
\subsubsection*{Material, metal and alloy price effects}
Description: Several companies call out metal or alloy price effects as drivers of gross margin volatility or as adjustments to EBIT.

Companies: Alleima; Sandvik; Volvo; Atlas Copco

Tone: negative

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "Metal price effects had an impact of SEK -70 million in Q3"
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "global trade restrictions on tungsten powder have led to stricter supplies, and significant price increases" (favorable for Sandvik)
  \item Evidence: Volvo: notes increased material and manufacturing costs affecting earnings
  \item Evidence: Atlas Copco: "Metal price effects and tariff costs affected margin negatively"
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Restructuring, efficiency measures and cost savings}
Description: Many companies are implementing restructuring and efficiency programs described as permanent cost savings, with associated one-off charges.

Companies: Alleima; Sandvik; SKF; Trelleborg; Volvo

Tone: mixed

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "measures will generate cost savings of just over SEK 200 million per year... non-recurring costs nearly SEK 400 million"
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "savings from the restructuring programs had a year-on-year bridge effect"
  \item Evidence: SKF: "rightsizing initiatives... savings primarily through 2026-2027"
  \item Evidence: Trelleborg: "Items affecting comparability pertained to restructuring costs"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: adjustments and provisions noted; Volvo CE restructuring and divestment of SDLG
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pricing and price/mix execution}
Description: Companies report pricing actions, surcharges to offset tariffs or pass through material cost increases; price/mix often cited as margin support.

Companies: Alleima; Atlas Copco; Sandvik; SKF; Trelleborg; Volvo

Tone: positive

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evidence: Alleima: "price leadership" and focus on price discipline
  \item Evidence: Atlas Copco: "margin was positively affected by currency, while increased costs related to trade tariffs and dilution from acquisitions affected the margin negatively" (price partly offset)
  \item Evidence: Sandvik: "Tariffs were fully off-set by surcharges" and "price fully off-set cost inflation"
  \item Evidence: SKF: "price and mix contribution" improved margin
  \item Evidence: Trelleborg: "Solid price/mix contribution"
  \item Evidence: Volvo: "good price realization" helped offset costs
\end{itemize}

\section*{B. Notable Differences}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Volvo explicitly quantifies large divestment impact (SDLG) and removed SEK 811m from adjusted operating income; Trelleborg also divested SDLG but framed as strategic; Sandvik and Atlas Copco list many bolt-on acquisitions and say acquisitions can dilute margins initially
  \item SKF emphasizes corporate reorganization and Automotive separation as a strategic driver and notes improved adjusted margin in a challenging market
  \item Alleima highlights a specific extended maintenance stoppage at Sandviken that materially affected production and earnings in the quarter
  \item Atlas Copco and Sandvik stress specialty rental and power equipment service growth as important contributors; Volvo highlights service but emphasizes vehicle order/backlog dynamics
  \item Volvo and SKF provide detailed truck/construction unit-level volumes and market share commentary; other companies provide segment-level demand color (e.g., Sandvik: Mining; Trelleborg: Mining/Industrial)
\end{itemize}
